# Animals Challenge

## Level 1

Write a program that will ask the user for an animal; for this challenge, limit the choices to cats and dogs. Then, ask the user the name of the animal. Then print `[name] meowed` or `[name] barked` respective to the animal they picked.

Ask the user how many animals they want. 

```
Number of animals: [3]

Animal 1 of 3:
CAT or DOG: [CAT]
Name: [Me-Mow]
Me-Mow meowed

Animal 2 of 3:
CAT or DOG: [DOG]
Name: [Jake]
Jake barked

Animal 3 of 3:
CAT or DOG: [DOG]
Name: [Herb]
Herb barked
```
> **Note:** `[content]` in the example input-output denotes `content` as user input. The symbols `[]` should not appear in your actual program.

> **Bonus**
> - Make the animal selection input case-insensitive
> - If the user chose an animal other than cat/dog, print `[name] talked`
